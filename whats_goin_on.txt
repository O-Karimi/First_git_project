THis file is kind of what I have done and What else I wanna add to the project. But in a brain storm kinda way:

Done deals :
1. a Greeting code.
2. Get users First and Family Name.
3. Identify person who runs the code. If the persson has come back to app Greet in another way.
4. Save how many times a person has come back to the app.

Bugs :
1. It  can not comprehend more thaan one digit number for coming back.

Features :
1. have a base beside name and family name (For same Name and Family names that are not one person)
2. Giving the option to the user to do some useful things after Greetings
3. Have a link to all their socials and give them link to their socials
4. Become a personal assisstant
5. Something like making a schedule and setting appointments in a calender
